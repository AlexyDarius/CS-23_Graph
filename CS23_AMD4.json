                            "Content": "The applicability of the acceptable means of compliance (AMC) is limited to the scope of CS-23 (Amendment 5 and later). The applicability of the individual AMC that are provided in Subpart B through G can be restricted to a specific type of design, type of operation or any other criterion. The applicability of each AMC is therefore specified within that AMC. Demonstration of compliance using a published AMC outside of that applicability does not provide for presumption of compliance with the related requirement. The AMC to CS-23 (Amendment 5 and later) illustrate means, but not the only means, by which a requirement contained in CS-23 can be met. Satisfactory demonstration of compliance using the AMC shall provide for presumption of compliance with the related requirement. The AMC are a way to facilitate certification tasks for the applicant and the competent authority. Due to changes in technology or application of technology in a way that has not been considered or not (yet) included in the AMC, the appropriate application of this AMC in the certification of a design requires a review by the authority. CS-23 (Amendment 5 and later) maintains the existing level of safety of CS-23 (Amendment 4 and CS-VLA Amendment 1), except for areas addressing loss of control and icing, for which the safety level was increased. Achieving this level of safety through compliance with CS-23 (Amendment 5 and later) for a given certification project may require the use of additional means of compliance beyond those provided in this AMC, depending on the details of the specific design. Applicants may propose designs with novel or unusual features for which neither AMC1 nor the EASA Certification Specifications (CS-23 Amendment 4 and CS-VLA Amendment 1) contain appropriate AMC for showing compliance with CS-23 (Amendment 5 and later). Therefore, applicants proposing the use of this AMC to CS-23 as a means of complying with CS-23 (Amendment 5 and later) for aeroplanes with novel or unusual design features may need to gain acceptance of additional means of compliance under CS 23.2010. AMC1 CS-23 Subpart B through Subpart G contains means of compliance that consist of a listing of consensus standards at their specific revisions that have been reviewed by EASA and accepted as AMC to CS-23. The scope and content of the referenced consensus standard can, however, differ from the overall scope of CS-23 or the objectives of the requirement. Therefore, using such a referenced consensus standard requires the applicant to identify what is applicable within that consensus standard and to seek agreement with the authority for agreement of the selected consensus standard and applied paragraphs. This is the so-called building-block flexibility that is built into the CS-23. The listing in AMC1 Subpart B through Subpart G is consistent with the administrative ASTM standard F3264 at the revision as specified. The AMC1 is therefore basically a copy of ASTM"
